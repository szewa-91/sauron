Three bank accounts for the Elven-kings under the sky,  
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,  
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,  
One unified API for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie  
One App to rule them all, one App to find them,  
One App to bring them all and in the darkness bind them  
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
